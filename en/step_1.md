Turtles don't have to be black! You can choose from lots of different colour names. 

```python
turtle.color('red')
```

Turtle color names include'gold', 'turquoise', 'indian red', and 'indigo'. You can find a list of options [here](jumpto.cc/colours).

Setting the turtle color affects the color of the turtle shape and the line it draws. It also affects the color used for `stamp`, `dot`, `circle` and `write`. Try it out here:
